### Predefined Text Paster

This is a Chrome extension that allows the user to right click and then select "Paste predefined text" from the context menu, which then inserts predefined text in a desired area (search field, document edit, etc). This extension requires that the predefined text is modified directly in the `content.js` file.

ChatGPT did most of the work in the creation of this extension. This allowed me to produce a working Chrome extension without having done so before. It took a couple of days, and I started over multiple times, and almost gave up. The code ChatGPT initially provided was outdated, which made it a struggle.

Here is the final conversation I had with ChatGPT that produced a working extension:
